# ðŸŽ¯ [Create Darty App](https://github.com/eserozvataf/create-darty-app)

## Update (July 2022)

When I started coding this project, I was strongly feeling that webpack isn't a
suffient tool for building a modern, production-ready frontend applications.

With Darty, I tried to make frontend development easy and more straight-forward
with single declarative manifest file. Even though I used webpack under the
hood, Darty was an opinionated frontend development environment and so many
complicated configurations are hidden from codebase.

Today I cannot maintain this project anymore as a single contributor. It needs
to be rewritten to compete with its current alternatives but it's impossible for
me at the moment. However abandoning projects are sad, I'm glad to see my idea
is somehow proved with the releases of Snowpack and Vite.

Please check out Vite for a community-supported, well-maintained webpack
alternative.

# README

Darty is a front-end development system to allow developers to start their
projects immediately. By Darty's convention over configuration mindset, webpack
and typescript compiler configurations are handled by darty's itself.

Create Darty App, simply downloads the selected darty project template to make
its user ready for development.

## Disclosure

The project was named as Dart after the dart game all we know. Although I think
it's a generic name, authorities from Google have claimed dart is a trademarked
name they own. They asked me to find a new name for this project. Otherwise,
they stated that their legal or trademark teams will be involved.

Sadly... that's the reason why I renamed this project as create-darty-app.
