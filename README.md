# 🎯 [Create Darty App](https://github.com/eserozvataf/create-darty-app)

Darty is a front-end development system to allow developers to start their projects
immediately. By Darty's convention over configuration mindset, webpack and typescript
compiler configurations are handled by darty's itself.

Create Darty App, simply downloads the selected darty project template to make its user
ready for development.


## Disclosure

The project was named as Dart after the dart game all we know. Although I think it's a generic name, authorities from Google have claimed dart is a trademarked name they own. They asked me to
find a new name for this project. Otherwise, they stated that their legal or trademark teams
will be involved.

Sadly... that's the reason why I renamed this project as create-darty-app.
